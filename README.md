# ShowMe Summary
  It's a personal app to show all the informations about myself.
# Background and History
  It was about one month ago,I catched up with an idea that is a big chance to do something special to me.To be honest,I start to considering whether to make changes half a year ago,but it all be delayed.Then after a year,I finished a project a few weeks ago,so there is more or less days to reconsider it again.
# What can it do?
  It was designed to help those who is not good at writing his or her resume,and also who has no confidence in themself.You can imagine there is a day when you step into the interviewer's office,you can simply pick out you phone or ipad from the pockets and show him the App to show youself instead of plenty of papers.
